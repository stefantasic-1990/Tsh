# tsh: a simple shell in C

## Motivation

Personal project implementing a basic shell program in C. Motivated by desire to learn more about low-level programming and OS internals.

## Feature Wishlist

These are the features I want the shell to have before I can call it complete.

- [ ] Basic single-line editing mode
- [ ] Command parsing with quoting and backslash escaping
- [ ] Persistant command history
- [ ] Command piping and redirection
